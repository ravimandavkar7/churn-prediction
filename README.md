# Business Problem & Objective
Customer churn is a major challenge for telecom companies, directly impacting revenue and growth. The objective of this project is to identify customers who are likely to churn and provide actionable insights that can help the business design effective retention strategies and reduce customer loss.

# Technical Summary
Built and optimized a telecom customer churn prediction model using Logistic Regression and Random Forest (scikit-learn). Performed EDA, feature engineering, SMOTE oversampling, and class-weight balancing to handle imbalance. Improved churn recall from 0.50 to 0.75 using probability threshold tuning (0.35), achieving 75% recall and 0.78 ROC-AUC on test data

# Key Business Insights
Customers on month-to-month contracts show significantly higher churn rates.
High monthly charges are strongly correlated with churn probability.
Long-tenure customers are more loyal and less likely to leave.

# Business Recommendations
Introduce incentives for customers to move to long-term contracts.
Provide targeted retention offers to high-risk customers.
Strengthen onboarding and engagement during the first 90 days.
