# churn-prediction
Built and optimized a telecom customer churn prediction model using Logistic Regression and Random Forest (scikit-learn). Performed EDA, feature engineering, SMOTE oversampling, and class-weight balancing to handle imbalance. Improved churn recall from 0.50 to 0.75 using probability threshold tuning (0.35), achieving 75% recall and 0.78 ROC-AUC on test data.
